//! `obj` — embedded document database (public crate).
//!
//! This crate is the user-facing surface of the `obj` storage
//! engine. It wraps the `obj-core` building blocks (pager, WAL,
//! B+tree, codec, catalog, transaction layer) into the typed
//! [`Db`] / [`Collection<T>`] API.
//!
//! Worked examples for every topic live next to the relevant item
//! in this crate's rustdoc:
//!
//! - Opening / CRUD: see [`Db::open`], [`Db::insert`], [`Db::get`],
//!   [`Db::update`], [`Db::delete`], [`Db::upsert`].
//! - Transactions: see [`Db::transaction`] and
//!   [`Db::read_transaction`].
//! - Iteration: see [`Db::iter_all`] and [`Db::all`].
//! - Queries: see [`Db::query`], [`Query::sort_by`],
//!   [`Query::index_range`], [`Query::count`].
//! - Attach / backup / integrity: see [`Db::attach`],
//!   [`Db::backup_to`], [`Db::integrity_check`].
//! - Configuration: see [`Config`].
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use obj::Db;
//! use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, obj::Document)]
//! struct Order { customer_id: u64, total_cents: u64 }
//!
//! fn run() -> obj::Result<()> {
//!     let db = Db::open("app.obj")?;
//!     let id = db.insert(Order { customer_id: 1, total_cents: 100 })?;
//!     let back: Option<Order> = db.get(id)?;
//!     assert!(back.is_some());
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Core CRUD and the `Document` derive
//!
//! Open a database with one of three constructors:
//!
//! - [`Db::open`] / [`Db::open_with`] — file-backed; creates if
//!   absent, reopens otherwise.
//! - [`Db::memory`] / [`Db::memory_with`] — in-memory, ephemeral.
//!   No persistence, no file locks. Useful for unit tests.
//! - [`Db::open_readonly`] — read-only against an existing file.
//!   Every mutating call returns
//!   [`Err(Error::ReadOnly { .. })`](Error::ReadOnly).
//!
//! Each `Db` is `Send + Sync`. Share across threads via `Arc<Db>`
//! for the concurrent-reader / single-writer workload.
//!
//! Implement the [`Document`] trait on every type you want to
//! persist. The [`obj::Document`](crate::Document) re-export is a
//! `proc-macro` that fills in the trait's associated constants
//! from optional `#[obj(...)]` attributes:
//!
//! - `#[obj(collection = "...")]` — sets [`Document::COLLECTION`].
//!   Default: the type name.
//! - `#[obj(version = N)]` — sets [`Document::VERSION`]. Default: 1.
//! - `#[obj(index)]`, `#[obj(index = unique)]`,
//!   `#[obj(index = each)]` on a field — declare secondary indexes
//!   (see § "Queries and indexes" below).
//! - `#[obj(index_composite(fields = ("a", "b")))]` at struct
//!   level — declare a composite index.
//!
//! The one-shot API runs each call inside a private transaction
//! and is the typical entry point for ad-hoc work:
//!
//! - [`Db::insert`] — allocate an `Id`, write the doc.
//! - [`Db::get`] — fetch by `Id`. Returns `Option<T>`.
//! - [`Db::update`] — apply a closure in place. Errors with
//!   [`Error::DocumentNotFound`] if the id is absent.
//! - [`Db::delete`] — remove by `Id`. Returns `true` if it existed.
//! - [`Db::upsert`] — insert-or-replace at a caller-supplied `Id`.
//! - [`Db::find_unique`] — point lookup on a `Unique` index.
//!   `O(log n)`, no collection scan.
//!
//! # Transactions and iteration
//!
//! For multi-document atomicity, [`Db::transaction`] runs a closure
//! with a `&mut WriteTxn`. The closure returns `Result<R>`; commit
//! on `Ok`, rollback on `Err`, rollback-via-`Drop` on panic. Inside
//! the closure, [`WriteTxn::collection`] yields a typed
//! [`Collection<T>`] handle whose methods compose with the parent
//! txn — every write rides one WAL transaction.
//!
//! For read-only consistency across multiple reads,
//! [`Db::read_transaction`] runs a closure with a `&ReadTxn`. The
//! closure observes one consistent snapshot of the database;
//! concurrent writers do not affect what it sees.
//!
//! For full-collection iteration there are two shapes:
//!
//! - [`Db::iter_all`] — streaming iterator over `Result<(Id, T)>`.
//!   Peak memory is bounded at a small constant (256 entries per
//!   refill) regardless of collection size.
//! - [`Db::all`] — one-line shim that drives `iter_all` to
//!   exhaustion and collects into `Vec<T>`. Pays memory
//!   proportional to the collection.
//!
//! See [`Db::transaction`] / [`Db::read_transaction`] for worked
//! examples of the closure shape.
//!
//! # Queries and indexes
//!
//! [`Db::query::<T>()`](Db::query) constructs a [`Query`] builder.
//! Compose with [`Query::filter`], [`Query::limit`],
//! [`Query::sort_by`], [`Query::index_range`]; terminate with
//! [`Query::fetch`] (materialised `Vec<T>`) or [`Query::count`]
//! (count alone, without decoding documents on the fast path).
//!
//! The query layer has two sources: a full primary-tree scan
//! (default) or an index-range slice ([`Query::index_range`]). No
//! cost-based planner — the caller picks. Source order is by
//! primary `Id` for the full scan and by encoded index-key bytes
//! for the index range.
//!
//! [`Query::sort_by`] materialises every surviving candidate into
//! a sort buffer before applying [`Query::limit`]. The buffer is
//! capped at [`MAX_SORT_BUFFER`] (100 000 documents); overflowing
//! the cap surfaces [`Error::SortBufferExceeded`]. Override the
//! cap with [`Query::sort_buffer_limit`] when the workload
//! genuinely needs more.
//!
//! Indexes are declared on the document type via
//! [`Document::indexes`] (or the derive's `#[obj(index ...)]`
//! attributes). The catalog reconciler runs on the first
//! [`WriteTxn::collection::<T>()`](WriteTxn::collection) call per
//! process per collection: it declares missing specs, marks
//! stale active descriptors `DroppedPending`, and is idempotent.
//! Reconciliation rides the caller's WAL transaction — a rolled-
//! back insert leaves no half-created index behind.
//!
//! Four [`IndexKind`]s are exposed: `Standard`, `Unique`, `Each`,
//! `Composite`. Construct typed [`IndexSpec`]s via
//! `IndexSpec::standard` / `::unique` / `::each` / `::composite`
//! when hand-implementing [`Document::indexes`].
//!
//! # Schema evolution
//!
//! Bump [`Document::VERSION`] on every breaking change. Register a
//! [`DynamicSchema`] for each prior version in
//! [`Document::historical_schemas`], and provide a
//! [`Document::migrate`] body that lifts the structured
//! [`obj_core::codec::Dynamic`] view into the current `Self`.
//!
//! Migration is lazy: a stored record whose `type_version` is
//! older than `Self::VERSION` is migrated on read but the on-disk
//! bytes are NOT rewritten until the next
//! [`Collection::update`] / [`Collection::upsert`] for that id.
//! The collection therefore scales to billions of documents
//! without a stop-the-world rebuild on schema bumps.
//!
//! - [`Error::SchemaNotRegistered`] surfaces when a stored
//!   `type_version` has no entry in `historical_schemas()`.
//! - [`Error::SchemaVersionFromFuture`] surfaces when the stored
//!   `type_version` is newer than `Self::VERSION` (downgrade
//!   attempt).
//!
//! Worked recipes for the four common patterns — single-version
//! migration, multi-version chains, tombstoned fields, enum-variant
//! migration — live on [`Document::migrate`] and in the
//! integration tests `historical_schemas.rs`, `tombstone_migration.rs`,
//! `enum_migration.rs`, and `lazy_migration.rs`. The lazy-rewrite
//! cycle itself is documented on [`Collection::get`].
//!
//! # Attach, backup, integrity
//!
//! [`Db::attach`] registers a read-only second `.obj` file under a
//! caller-chosen namespace. Any [`Document`] whose `COLLECTION` is
//! of the form `<namespace>.<name>` dispatches reads against the
//! attached file; writes against a namespaced collection return
//! [`Error::AttachedDatabaseIsReadOnly`]. Each attached database
//! gets its own snapshot pinned at read-transaction begin;
//! [`Db::detach`] removes the registry entry but in-flight reads
//! complete against their pinned snapshot.
//!
//! **Which one?** Attach/detach come in two receiver flavours that do
//! the same work. Reach for the `&mut self` [`Db::attach`] /
//! [`Db::detach`] when you own the `Db` outright (an exclusive borrow
//! is the simplest expression of "no reads are racing this mutation").
//! Reach for the `&self` [`Db::attach_shared`] / [`Db::detach_shared`]
//! when the handle is shared and you cannot get `&mut` — typically an
//! `Arc<Db>` cloned across threads. Both mutate the same
//! interior-mutable, mutex-guarded registry, so the choice is purely
//! about which receiver your call site can produce. (The async
//! `AsyncDb::attach` only offers the `&mut self` form; see its docs
//! for how it behaves when the inner `Arc` is shared.)
//!
//! [`Db::backup_to`] writes a self-contained `.obj` file at the
//! LSN of an internally-taken reader snapshot. Writers continue
//! against the source; post-snapshot writes are NOT in the
//! destination. Two failure modes:
//! [`Error::BackupDestinationExists`] (refuses to overwrite) and
//! [`Error::BackupNotSupportedForMemoryPager`] (in-memory dbs have
//! no file backend to copy from).
//!
//! [`Db::integrity_check`] runs a full bidirectional walk: every
//! active collection's primary + index B-trees, freelist sweep,
//! orphan-page detection, primary↔index cross-reference. Returns
//! [`IntegrityReport`] with a `failures` list and a
//! `pages_checked` count. The lightweight subset that
//! [`Db::open`] runs at open time is
//! `obj_core::integrity::quick_check`; opt out of the open-time
//! walk via [`Config::skip_open_check`].
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! [`Config`] is a `Clone` builder. Defaults match a
//! "production-safe" posture:
//!
//! - [`Config::cache_size`] — bytes for the pager's LRU. Default
//!   256 KiB (64 frames). Larger for read-heavy workloads on
//!   large databases; smaller on memory-constrained targets.
//! - [`Config::sync_mode`] — durability mode for every WAL
//!   commit. Default [`SyncMode::Full`] (system-wide power loss
//!   survivable). [`SyncMode::Normal`] for `fsync`-only
//!   durability; [`SyncMode::Off`] only for tests and benchmarks.
//! - [`Config::busy_timeout`] — max wait when acquiring the
//!   reader / writer lock. Default 5 seconds. Beyond the budget,
//!   the txn returns [`Err(Error::Busy)`](Error::Busy) rather
//!   than blocking indefinitely.
//! - [`Config::skip_open_check`] — opt out of the open-time
//!   catalog walk. Default `false` (run the walk). Production
//!   callers should leave it on.
//! - [`Config::cross_process_lock`] — toggle OS-level byte-range
//!   locking. Default `true` (on). Off only when every accessor
//!   shares one `Db` inside one process (in-process stress tests).
//!
//! # Cargo features
//!
//! - `serde` (off by default) — derive `serde::Serialize` and
//!   `serde::Deserialize` on the public types in this crate
//!   (`Config`, `DbStat`, `CollectionStat`, `DumpRecord`,
//!   `IntegrityReport`, `IntegrityFailure`, plus the obj-core
//!   re-exports `Id`, `SyncMode`, `LockKind`, `IndexKind`,
//!   `IndexSpec`). When the feature is on, `Serialize` and
//!   `Deserialize` are also re-exported from the crate root, so
//!   downstream callers do not need a separate `serde` dependency.
//!   Pure additive surface — no on-disk format byte changes.
//! - `tracing` (off by default) — emit structured spans around the
//!   observability surface: `db.open`, `db.transaction`,
//!   `db.read_transaction`, `db.integrity_check`, `query.execute`,
//!   and the obj-core `pager.checkpoint` span (propagated via the
//!   `obj-core/tracing` sub-feature). The feature gates the
//!   optional `tracing` dependency on both crates so the default
//!   build has zero new transitive deps and zero span overhead.
//!   `tracing` is intentionally NOT re-exported from this crate —
//!   downstream subscribers add `tracing-subscriber` (or another
//!   subscriber crate) directly, mirroring the idiom used by
//!   `tokio` and `axum`.
//! - `compression` (off by default) — LZ4 per-page compression at
//!   the pager layer. Propagates to obj-core.
//!   Every v1.0 writer stamps `format_minor = 2` regardless of which
//!   codecs are enabled; whether a file *uses* compression is
//!   recorded by `feature_flags` bit 0, not by the minor. A build
//!   WITHOUT this feature opens any file whose bit 0 is clear, and
//!   refuses (with `Error::FormatFeatureUnsupported`) only a file
//!   that actually has the compression flag set.
//! - `encryption` (off by default) — XChaCha20-Poly1305 per-page
//!   at-rest encryption. Propagates to
//!   obj-core. As with compression, the file's minor is always 2;
//!   `feature_flags` bit 1 records whether the file is encrypted. A
//!   build WITHOUT this feature opens any file whose bit 1 is clear,
//!   and refuses (with `Error::FormatFeatureUnsupported`) a file
//!   whose bit 1 is set — the refusal keys off the feature flag, not
//!   the minor version.
//! - `async` (off by default) — runtime-agnostic async surface
//!   mirroring the blocking [`Db`] / [`Collection`] / [`Query`]
//!   API behind a new `obj::asynchronous` module. Work is routed
//!   through the
//!   `blocking` crate's process-wide
//!   thread pool, so the wrapper composes with Tokio, smol, and any
//!   other async runtime — no per-runtime
//!   sub-features. With the feature off the baseline build adds
//!   no new transitive dependencies and no async overhead.
//!
//! # Observability
//!
//! Enable the `tracing` feature to emit spans around database
//! operations; spans are gated and free when the feature is off.
//! The span set is small and stable: one `info`-level span at every
//! transaction boundary, one `debug`-level span at every query
//! execution and pager checkpoint. No span field captures user
//! payload bytes — the only string-ish field is `path` on
//! `db.open`, which is a filesystem path rather than user content.
//!
//! # `unsafe` policy
//!
//! This crate is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. All `unsafe` lives in
//! `obj-core::platform` and carries a documented safety contract.

/// # Schema evolution
///
/// Evolving a stored type is `(version bump) + (migrate)`: bump

/// *How the old shape is recovered*, below). For the overwhelmingly
/// common case — **adding fields** — you do not write the `migrate`
/// body at all; the derive writes it.
///
/// ## Additive changes: `#[obj(auto_migrate)]` (start here)
///
/// When a version bump **only adds fields** (no removals, renames, or
/// type changes), add `#[obj(auto_migrate)]` to the struct and you are
/// done. The derive generates `migrate`: every current field is read
/// from the older record's `Dynamic` map by name — pre-existing fields
/// carry over (deserialised into the current field type) and fields
/// added in this version backfill with `Default::default()`, or with a
/// per-field `#[obj(default = <expr>)]` override.
///
/// ```
/// # fn main() -> obj::Result<()> {
/// use obj::{Db, Document};
/// use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
///
/// let dir = tempfile::tempdir()?;
/// let path = dir.path().join("auto_evo.obj");
///
/// // v1: a plain derived Document.
/// let id = {
///     #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Document)]
///     #[obj(version = 1, collection = "auto_customers")]
///     struct Customer { name: String, email: String }
///     let db = Db::open(&path)?;
///     db.insert(Customer { name: "Ada".into(), email: "ada@x.io".into() })?
/// };
///
/// // v2: adds `tier`; the derive generates `migrate`. No hand-impl.
/// #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Document)]
/// #[obj(version = 2, collection = "auto_customers", auto_migrate)]
/// struct Customer {
///     name: String,
///     email: String,
///     // Custom backfill for the new field (defaults to "" otherwise).
///     #[obj(default = "standard".to_owned())]
///     tier: String,

///
/// let db = Db::open(&path)?;
/// let back: Customer = db.get(id)?.ok_or(obj::Error::InvalidArgument("missing"))?;

/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// This is the recommended path for additive evolution. `Option<T>`
/// fields, enum fields, and derived indexes all carry through
/// unchanged. The pattern is exercised end-to-end by the
/// `derive_auto_migrate.rs` integration test (additive fields, custom
/// `default`, `Option` / enum carry-over, index composition, and the
/// rename boundary called out below).
///
/// ## When you must hand-write `migrate`
///
/// `auto_migrate` handles the pure-additive case only. Fall back to a
/// hand-written [`Document::migrate`] whenever the change is **not**
/// purely additive:

/// - the backfill must **vary by `from_version`**.
///
/// The generated body is documented at

/// hand-written `migrate` are mutually exclusive — both define the same
/// method, so declaring both is a compile error. A field whose type is
/// not `Default` (and carries no `#[obj(default = <expr>)]`) makes the
/// generated body fail to compile — a loud, intentional signal that the
/// change is not purely additive.
///
/// To migrate by hand, hand-write the type's [`Document`] impl and
/// **override [`Document::migrate`]**. Do *not* write `impl Migrate for
/// T` — the [`Migrate`](obj_core::codec::Migrate) trait has a blanket
/// impl over every `Document`, so a direct impl conflicts and fails to
/// compile. Read the old fields out of the `Dynamic` map per field;

///    (sourced from disk) and hands your `migrate` body the resulting

/// impl for each one-step hop. `migrate` reconstructs the record at its
/// own version, then walks the `From` chain up to the current shape —
/// each upgrade step is written once and composes:

/// ## How the old shape is recovered
///
/// **How the shape gets onto disk.** Every typed write persists the
/// running version's schema into a reserved row of the catalog B+tree,
/// in the same WAL transaction as the document. The disk catalog holds
/// a schema row for version `K` **iff** some process running version-`K`
/// code wrote a version-`K` document to this file. At read time the
/// decoder sources the old shape from that row, not from a live old
/// class.
///
/// **Load-bearing invariant.** *A document stamped version `N` is
/// decodable iff a `(collection, N)` schema row exists on disk.* The
/// write path guarantees the row commits before (or with) the first
/// version-`N` document, so for any file written by this engine the
/// invariant always holds. There is no compiled-in read fallback.
///
/// Old records read through the new type are migrated in memory; their
/// on-disk bytes are not rewritten until the next `update` / `upsert`.
/// The collection therefore scales to billions of docs without a
/// stop-the-world rebuild on every schema change.
///
/// A stored record whose `type_version` is newer than
/// `Self::VERSION` surfaces [`Error::SchemaVersionFromFuture`]; an
/// older `type_version` with no schema row on disk surfaces
/// [`Error::SchemaNotRegistered`]. For tombstoned fields and
/// enum-variant migration recipes, see the integration tests
/// `disk_schema_migration.rs`, `schema_evolution.rs`,
/// `tombstone_migration.rs`, `enum_migration.rs`, and
/// `lazy_migration.rs`.
